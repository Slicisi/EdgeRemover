# Edge Removal Script

## Description
This PowerShell script automates the process of uninstalling Edge from your system. It stops all Edge-related processes, deletes Edge directories, and removes associated registry entries.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **PowerShell Version**: PowerShell 5.1 or newer (comes pre-installed on Windows 10 and later versions)

## Usage
1. **Download the Script**:
   - Clone or download the `EdgeRemove.ps1` script from this repository.

2. **End active Edge Tasks**:

3. **Run the Script as Administrator**:
   - Right-click on `EdgeRemove.ps1` and select "Run as administrator". This script requires administrative privileges to stop processes, delete directories, and modify registry entries.

4. **Follow On-screen Instructions**:
   - The script will prompt you to confirm certain actions (like stopping processes or deleting files). Follow the prompts to proceed.

5. **Completion**:
   - Once the script finishes running, it will display a message indicating that Edge processes, directories, and registry entries have been successfully removed.
